# FreePosts
Content manager for blog posts

By default the application is populated with a database in sqlite. It is necessary to adjust the relative path of the server in the **core** file.
The default is to add the application right after the hostname, such as: **http://hostname/freeposts/?query=string**.
However, in the core class it is possible to adjust a sub directory.
Feel free to modify the project for your use, if you find a bug, please report it so that the application gets better and better.
